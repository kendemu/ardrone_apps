Applications for the AR.Drone

Currently, there are three applications:
 - Keyboard teleop
 - PS3 teleop
 - A basic moving application. This assumes that to get to a position x meters away from you, it takes 1 + sqrt(x) seconds of moving constanting in that direction to get there. This is close enough to correct.

Notes:
This depends on the ardrone_autonomy package.
You can find it at https://github.com/AutonomyLab/ardrone_autonomy

TODO:
 - Come up with other apps
