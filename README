Applications for the AR.Drone

Currently, there is an (unfinished) Keyboard teleop for the ARDrone. It is based off the Turtlebot's keyboard teleop, and currently only allows movement in the x and y linear directions (does not turn, does not move up or down).

Notes:
This depends on the ardrone_autonomy package.
You can find it at https://github.com/AutonomyLab/ardrone_autonomy

TODO:
 - Teleop:
   - Add movement in z linear direction, and allow turning.
   - add joystick movement
 - Come up with other apps
