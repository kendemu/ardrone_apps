Applications for the AR.Drone

Currently, there is a keyboard teleop for the ARDrone. I would like to see if I can get fuerte's navstack to work on it, but if that requires an openni device, then that's not happening.

Notes:
This depends on the ardrone_autonomy package.
You can find it at https://github.com/AutonomyLab/ardrone_autonomy

TODO:
 - Teleop:
   - add joystick control (e.g. control from a ps3)
 - Come up with other apps
